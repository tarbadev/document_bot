## Abstract

This document provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning concepts, covering supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. It is designed for students and practitioners looking to understand the fundamentals of modern AI systems.

## Introduction

Machine learning has revolutionized how we approach problem-solving in computer science. From image recognition to natural language processing, ML algorithms have become essential tools in modern technology.

## Key Concepts

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, models learn from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning algorithms find patterns in data without pre-existing labels.

### Deep Learning
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data.

## Conclusion

Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for anyone working in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
